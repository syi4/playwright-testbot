# How I got into webscraping

* I was mad because all these bots were buying up kaws figures I really liked.

* Started out with selenium but later found out that puppeteer had a faster execution time.

* After playing around with puppeteer and doing some more research, I came across playwright.

* Same creators of puppeteer so the syntax is pretty much the same and plus, they had some cool debugging tools.

* Playwright has its own built in test runner so I thought to myself why don't I try writing some UI tests on my own site.
